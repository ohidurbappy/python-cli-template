# python-cli-template

A template for writing python cli programs.

## About 

Everytime I write a new script, I include some boilerplate code. Either I have to
copy paste or write it everytime. This repo is here to save some time.

This template doesn't contain a `setup.py` file and it's by choice.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/ohidurbappy/python-cli-template.git
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Features

- Import Error Message
- Logging
- Keyboard Interrupt Handling
- gitignore
- Argument Parsing
- Cache Key/Value
- Reading .env files
- Automatically install missing dependencies
